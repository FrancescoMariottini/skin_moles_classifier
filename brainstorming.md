  Data: Three sets (Set_D, Set_E and Set_F) of mole images
  
  Companies' request: to detect moles that need to be handle by doctors.
  
  Our mission: AI that detects when the mole is dangerous
  
  ---

1. **Classification problem**

Things we need to clarify by **EMAIL**

      - Which are these 3 categories exactly? What is/are the dangerous mole(s)? What is a dangerous mole and how it relates to the 3 sets.

      - Do we need to predict 2 possible classes (dangerous/not dangerous) from 3 categories or rather predict these 3 categories?
      
      - Source of data (patients?)
      
      - Is there an ordinal classification in the sets (e.g., from less -Set_D- to more alarming -Set_F- )?
      
      

2. **General steps**

- Joachim: Create dataset

- Orhan and Francesco: explore OpenCV and Scikit-learn 
  - Orhan: technical, practical part (which tool is better for us?)
  - Francesco: 'theoretical' part (e.g., which image features are better to focuso on?)

- Build prediction model

- Build an API

- Use Docker to deploy the app

- Create the presentation
