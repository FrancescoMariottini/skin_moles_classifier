  Data: Three sets (Set_D, Set_E and Set_F) of mole images
  
  Companies' request: to detect moles that need to be handle by doctors.
  
  Our mission: AI that detects when de mole is dangerous

1. **Classification problem**

Things we need to clarify (maybe through an email?)

      - Do we need to predict 2 possible classes (dangerous/not dangerous) from 3 categories or rather predict these 3 categories?
      
      - Is there an ordinal classification in the sets (e.g., from less -Set_D- to more alarming -Set_F- )?
      
      

2. **General steps**

- Preprocess images with OpenCV

- Build prediction model

- Build an API

- Use Docker to deploy the app

- Create the presentation
